Open Ports:

# 53 (Domain) – This port runs DNS. If not secured, it can be used for DNS spoofing or amplification attacks.
# 80 (HTTP) – This is used for web traffic but is not encrypted. Attackers can sniff data or inject content if there's no HTTPS fallback.
# 443 (HTTPS) – Secure web traffic. Safer than HTTP, but if misconfigured (e.g., expired certs), it can still be vulnerable.
Filtered Ports:
# 21 (FTP) – Used for file transfer. If it were open and unencrypted, it could leak login credentials.
# 23 (Telnet) – An old protocol used for remote access. It’s insecure by default (plain text), and should be avoided
